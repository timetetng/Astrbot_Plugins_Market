# [AstrBot Plugin Marketplace](https://plugins.lsgbin.com/)

**THE ORIGIN SITE GOT SOMETHING WRONG THAT HAD A 404 ERROR**

That is why this repo forked here.

And I make a little update, enjoy it -> https://plugins.lsgbin.com

A simple AstrBot plugin marketplace page for showcasing plugins for the AstrBot framework.

## Features

* 📦 Browse all available AstrBot plugins
* 🔍 Search for specific plugins
* 🌓 Support for dark/light theme switching

## Deployment

The project uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages and Vercel. Each push to the `astrbot-plugins-market` branch will automatically trigger the build and deployment process. But some configuration issues require manual deployment on Vercel.
